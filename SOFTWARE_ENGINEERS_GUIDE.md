# Hey New Software Engineers! üëã

Welcome to the team! We built this cool route optimization thing and now you get to use it. Don't worry if you're new - this guide is super simple and we'll walk through everything step by step.

## What This Thing Does üéØ

Basically, we have a bunch of cool tourist spots and roadside attractions across California (National Parks, the World's Largest Redwood Tree Gas Station, the Hollywood Sign, etc.) and this API helps you figure out the best way to visit them all. It's like having a super smart travel planner that tells you the shortest route between these great stops in the Golden State!

## Getting Started (Super Easy) üöÄ

### Step 1: Start the API
Open your terminal and type:
```bash
cd backend
python3 start_api.py
```

You should see something like:
```
üöÄ Starting Route Optimization API Server...
‚úÖ Dependencies are installed
üì° API will be available at: http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 2: Test It Works
In another terminal window, type:
```bash
python3 test_api.py
```

If everything is green with ‚úÖ marks, you're good to go!

### Step 3: Check Out the Interactive Docs
Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

This is like a playground where you can test all the features without writing any code!

## What You Can Do With This API üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Get All the Cool Places
**What it does:** Shows you all the USA roadside attractions we have
**How to use it:** Just visit `http://localhost:8000/locations` in your browser

### 2. Find the Best Route
**What it does:** Takes a bunch of places and figures out the shortest way to visit them all
**How to use it:** Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/optimize`

### 3. Compare Routes
**What it does:** Shows you how much better our optimized route is compared to a random one
**How to use it:** Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/compare`

### 4. Get Real Road Directions
**What it does:** Gives you actual driving directions (not just straight lines)
**How to use it:** Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/street-routing`

## Cool Places You Can Visit üó∫Ô∏è

We have these awesome USA roadside attractions:
1. **Oceanfront Walk** (Venice, California)
2. **Palisade Garden Roller Skating** (San Diego, California)
3. **World's Largest Redwood Tree Service Station** (Ukiah, California)
4. **Motel Crystal Pier** (Pacific Beach, California)
5. **The Donut Hole** (La Puente, California)
6. **Giant Artichoke** (Castroville, California)
7. **The Deli Station** (Modesto, California)
8. **Crest Theater** (Fresno, California)
9. **Green Pines Mini Golf** (Redding, California)

These are all real roadside attractions from our dataset of nearly 1000 points of interest dotted around California!

## How to Use It in Your Code üíª

### JavaScript (for websites)
```javascript
// Get all the places
fetch('http://localhost:8000/locations')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Cool places:', data.data.locations);
  });

// Find the best route
fetch('http://localhost:8000/optimize', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ location_ids: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('Best route:', data.data.optimized_route);
});
```

### Python (if you like Python)
```python
import requests

# Get all places
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/locations')
places = response.json()['data']['locations']
print('Cool places:', places)

# Find best route
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/optimize', json={
    'location_ids': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
})
best_route = response.json()['data']['optimized_route']
print('Best route:', best_route)
```

## What the Responses Look Like üìù
**Will need to update this with our CA locations instead of locations from all around the country**
When you ask for the best route, you get something like:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "optimized_route": {
      "location_ids": [4, 3, 0, 2, 1],
      "location_names": ["The Donut Hole", "Mickey's Diner", "Teapot Dome gas station", "World's Largest Redwood Tree Service Station", "Hat n' Boots gas station"],
      "total_distance": 3381.2,
      "execution_time": 0.003
    }
  }
}
```

This means:
- Visit The Donut Hole first
- Then Mickey's Diner
- Then Teapot Dome gas station
- Then World's Largest Redwood Tree Service Station
- Finally Hat n' Boots gas station
- Total distance: 3,381 km
- It took 0.003 seconds to figure this out (super fast!)

## Cool Features üåü

### Super Fast
- Finds the best route in less than 0.01 seconds
- Works with up to 9 places at once

### Smart Optimization
- Usually 30-50% better than random routes
- Saves hundreds of kilometers of driving

### Real Road Data
- Gets actual driving directions
- Shows real travel times
- Uses real road networks

### Easy to Use
- Just send HTTP requests
- Works with any programming language
- Has interactive docs for testing

### Real Data from Real California Locations
- Uses actual roadside attractions from our dataset

## Common Questions ü§î

### "What if I want to add my own places?"
Use the `/locations` POST endpoint! You can add hotels, restaurants, or anywhere you want to visit.

### "How accurate is this?"
Pretty accurate! It uses real road data and actual driving distances, not just straight lines.

### "What if something goes wrong?"
Check the health endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/health`
If it says "healthy", everything is working fine.

### "Can I use this in my app?"
Absolutely! That's what it's for. Just make HTTP requests from whatever programming language you're using.

### "Where does this data come from?"
We have a dataset of about 1000 roadside attractions and points of interest across California, including historical monuments, National Parks, gas stations, diners, motels, and other quirky places. The API uses a curated selection of the most interesting ones.

## Troubleshooting üîß

### "The server won't start"
- Make sure you're in the `backend` folder
- Try `python3 start_api.py` (not `python`)
- Check if you have all the dependencies installed

### "I get connection errors"
- Make sure the server is running
- Check that you're using `http://localhost:8000`
- Try the health check first: `http://localhost:8000/health`

### "The API returns errors"
- Check the interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Make sure you're sending the right data format
- Look at the error message - it usually tells you what's wrong

## Need Help? üÜò

- **Interactive Testing**: Go to `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- **Test Everything**: Run `python3 test_api.py`
- **More Docs**: Check `backend/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## That's It! üéâ

You now have access to a super cool route optimization API that uses real USA roadside attractions. You can:
- Build travel planning apps for road trips
- Make delivery route optimizers
- Create tour guide applications for quirky attractions
- Build logistics dashboards

The data science team did all the hard work (the math, the algorithms, the optimization), and now you just get to use it through simple HTTP requests. Pretty sweet, right?

Go build something awesome! üöÄ
