# California Trip Planner â€“ Data Science Report

## Technical Staff: Eli Adams and Michael Turner

## Introduction to the Dataset

For this project, we worked with a dataset of tourist attractions across California. The data was sourced from a variety of public databases (Kaggle, explorethedata.com) and cleaned using Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy. The dataset includes information on the name, category, description, latitude, longitude, and city of each attraction, which allowed us to map the data spatially and segment it by region.

Preprocessing involved handling missing values, standardizing city names, removing duplicates, and filtering out non-relevant or incomplete records. We also created a cleaned version of the dataset that included only attractions with valid coordinates and sufficient descriptive categorical information. The final dataset was used to explore trends across cities and regions, support model development, and create visualizations.

This report includes an overview of our data preparation, route optimization model, visualizations, and key conclusions. Visual elements were created using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for both static and interactive insights.

## Model Description

Our core modeling task was to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** for a user-selected list of up to 9 attractions. We first built a baseline model that generated a random route between the selected attractions and calculated the total distance traveled.

To improve this, we implemented an optimized solution using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Genetic Algorithms are inspired by natural selection and evolution. Our GA begins by creating a population of random routes. Each generation after that, routes are ranked by fitness (inversely related to total distance), and the best routes are preserved (elitism). New routes are created by combining parts of parent routes (crossover) and occasionally introducing small changes (mutation) to maintain diversity.

We used Python and libraries such as NumPy and random, and implemented custom logic for selection, ordered crossover, mutation, and evolution. After 100 generations, the algorithm converged on an optimized route that significantly reduced travel distance compared to the baseline. This approach was chosen after experimenting with other heuristics, but the GA provided the best balance of flexibility, scalability, and performance.

## Visualizations

### 1. **United States Heatmap of Tourist Attractions**

This heatmap shows the the states in the country with the most and least amount of tourist attractions found in our dataset. Our goal in building this was to determine which state would not only provide enough points of interest to display on the map and have our model select from, but also provide enough mileage so that multiple routes could be compared against each other to find the most optimal path. This visualization was created using Python and HTML

### 2. **Top 10 Cities by Number of Attractions in California**

This bar chart shows the top ten cities in California with the most tourist attractions in our dataset. The goal was to identify urban areas with dense concentrations of attractions. Unsurprisingly, cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco ranked highest, reflecting their strong tourism infrastructure. The visualization was created using Seaborn and includes rotated x-axis labels for readability.

### 3. **Attractions by California Region**

This horizontal bar chart compares the number of attractions across Northern, Central, and Southern California. The chart makes it easy to see that Southern California has the highest number of attractions, aligning with expectations due to its large urban centers and numerous tourist destinations. This chart provided context for regional planning in our route model.

### 4. **Interactive Route Map**

We used Plotly to generate an interactive map that shows both the baseline random route and the optimized route generated by our model. Each location is marked with a label, and lines connect the points in travel order. This map allows users to visually compare travel paths and appreciate the efficiency gains from the optimized algorithm.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we successfully built a data-driven route planner that helps users optimize their California road trips. The combination of real-world data, a genetic algorithm, and interactive visualizations allowed us to demonstrate meaningful improvements in route efficiency. In the future, we could integrate additional data sources such as user preferences, attraction popularity, or live traffic data to further enhance the route customization and relevance for individual travelers, as well as use the complete datasets to expand into different states in the country.
